                <p>Yao Akato here, I am the Founder & CEO of Quality Education & Water For All (QEWFA). I am originally from Togo, West Africa but have been living in the US for the last 11 years. I have always had a passion for helping people and being
                    a beacon of change and improvement. It has been my life’s goal to help women and children from a very young age and It means the world to me that these goals are coming to reality. What made me want to start this organization was the
                    realization I received during my first trip back home only to see that nothing had really changed in the 10 years I had been gone. I knew that I had to act and be the change I wanted to see.</p>
